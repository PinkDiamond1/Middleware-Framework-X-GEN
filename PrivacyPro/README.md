## PrivacyPro Description

Characteristics of weak central password authorization mode based on attribute password:  
a) Efficiency: the cost of encryption and decryption and the length of ciphertext are only linearly related to the number of corresponding attributes, but not to the number of users in the system;  
b) Privacy: the encryptor does not need to know the identity of the decryptor  
c) Dynamic: whether the private key of user attribute can decrypt a ciphertext only depends on whether its attribute satisfies the ciphertext policy, but not on whether it generates the private key before the ciphertext is generated. In addition, it also has the Undo function

The original centralized authority is distributed to multiple centers, and the decentralization also enhances the security. Because the single point bottleneck problem is solved, the key secret parameters are not stored anywhere. At the same time, the threshold is increased and the fault tolerance is enhanced. It is not necessary for all centers to be online at the same time.
